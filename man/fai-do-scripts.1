.SH "NAME"
fai\-do\-scripts \- call configuration scripts
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B fai\-do\-scripts
.RI [OPTION] " DIRECTORY"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This command is only called internally by FAI and not directly by the user.

fai\-do\-scripts executes all scripts in DIRECTORY which are also a
defined class. If the name of the class is a directory, all scripts
that match `<CLASSNAME>/^[0\-9][0\-9].*' (starting with two digits) in this
directory are executed.  So it is
possible to have several scripts of different types (shell,
cfengine,...) be executed for one class.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-h
Show help, version and summary of options.
.TP
.B \-L DIR
Write log files to DIR.
.TP
.B \-n
Show type of scripts that would be executed, but do not execute them.

.SH "EXAMPLES"

   # fai\-do\-scripts /fai/scripts
